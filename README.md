# Open Source Icons

A picture paints a thousand words!

I have always used visulaisation and icons in various videos, presentation and diagrams to help deliver useful information. Sometimes you may not be able to find the right icon to fit your need or it costs.

Any icons I create myself will be published here for anyone to use.
